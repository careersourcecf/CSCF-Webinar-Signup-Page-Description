				<br>
				<br>The Federal Bonding Program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, serves as a tool to secure the job placement of ex-offenders and other high-risk applicants by issuing Fidelity bonds to businesses who offer jobs to workers in "at risk" groups. These bonds are business insurance policies that protect the employer in case of any loss of money or property due to employee dishonesty. “At-risk” groups include:

				<ul>
					<li>Justice involved individuals</li>
					<li>Recovering substance abusers (alcohol or drugs)</li>
					<li>Welfare recipients and other persons having poor financial credit, or who have declared bankruptcy</li>
					<li>Economically disadvantaged youth and adults who lack a work history</li>
					<li>Individuals dishonorably discharged from the military</li>
					<li>Anyone who cannot secure employment without bonding service</li>
				</ul>
