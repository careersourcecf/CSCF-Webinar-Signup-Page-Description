				<br>
				<br>The Federal Bonding Program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, serves as a tool to secure the job placement of ex-offenders and other high-risk applicants by issuing Fidelity bonds to businesses who offer jobs to workers in "at risk" groups. These bonds are business insurance policies that protect the employer in case of any loss of money or property due to employee dishonesty. “At-risk” groups include:
                 <ul>
                     <li>Justice involved individuals</li>
                     <li>Recovering substance abusers (alcohol or drugs)</li>
                     <li>Welfare recipients and other persons having poor financial credit, or who have declared bankruptcy</li>
                     <li>Economically disadvantaged youth and adults who lack a work history</li>
                     <li>Individuals dishonorably discharged from the military</li>
                     <li>Anyone who cannot secure employment without bonding service</li>
                 </ul>

				<br>
				<p>The COVID-19 pandemic changed how we do business. Many organizations had to close doors 100%, while others had to rethink and shift how they continued to operate. As our country begins to "Re-Open" and get back into "Normal" or "New-Normal" operations, it is critical for employers to put measures in place to "Re-board" staff coming back to workplaces.
                </p>
				<p>Join us for a 90-minute, interactive session to discuss re-boarding your existing staff or onboarding new staff once you re-open your doors. The session will explore potential approaches, suggested practices and offer insight to welcome back staff into a new mindset of service to your customers/guests. While this session will have some key points, the request is participants bring questions and scenarios to share and discuss with the group.</p>
